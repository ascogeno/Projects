        <h4>I've been scammed out of snacks. What do I do?</h4>
        <p>Dispute it! Beg for more, and if that doesn't work you may be entitled to compensation</p>
        <h4>My owner pretended to throw the ball, but when I looked back at them they still had it in their hands. How?</h4>
        <p>We're not entirely sure how they do that, but if it keeps occuring you may be able to file for defamation of your character as a dog with these continued abuses</p>
        <h4>I was told we were going to the park, but instead we went to the vet! What are my options?</h4>
        <p>That one's a bit tricky, but you may be able to class-action suit for false advertisement. We may also be able to get a kidnapping charge, and even malpractice on the part of the clinic</p>
        <h4>Why a pawfirm?</h4>
        <p>See the above questions. No other lawfirm will stand by dogs in issues like these, even though we're "man's best friend". We're here to represent you!</p>

        <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i><h3>What's the story of Golden and Murdog?</h3>
            <div>
                Originally Feynine and Co Law Offices, Mia Feynine was tragically murdered at the hands of 
                another she was investigating for blackmail. Former subordinate Nick Golden took up the case defending their
                sister of the crime, and has since taken over the law office. From then it's grown to what it is today!</div></section>

        <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i><h3>What's Inusuke's story? Who's he?</h3>
            <div>
                Inusuke was a great Ancestor of Nick Golden, origninally from Japan. Life certainly took some turns for the young dog, his field of study was English initially, not law!<br>
                After being accused of a murder he didn't commit, he succesfully defended himself in court. The victim was British, hence his trial was under severe scrutiny by both the British and Japanese governments.
                His friend brought him in secret on a steamship to Britain on a study tour, only to tragically lose his life on that very boat. The study tour was predicated on a lawyer being section
                to Britain from Japan, so Inusuke took the remainder of the 4 month voyage to study what he could to take his dear friends place.<br>
                Inusuke would then go on to establish themselves as one of the greatest barristers London had seen since the turn of the century</div></section>
