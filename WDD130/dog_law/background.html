                <p>Maya Feynine here is our secretary, we couldn't do a thing here without them. They've actually learned how to use a keyboard, 
                    a remarkable feat for any dog. Their sister was tragically killed, and Nick Golden was able to defend them in court. Ever since, they've
                    been stuck together like glue, and have been essential ever since Golden took over what was formerly Feynine and Co.
