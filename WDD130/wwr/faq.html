    <main class="home-grid">
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3> Where can I go to book some time for white-water rafting?</h3>
        <div>
            On our homepage, beneath the navigation bar is a sizable red button, that reads "Book Now". Try giving that a click and 
            see what happens! </div></section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>I'm not too familiar with this whole operation, what kind of activities can I 
        expect from booking?</h3>
        <div>
            ...Again, on our homepage, if you scroll down a little bit you'll see three cards with images and text that accomapany them. I 
            think that by taking a look at those you'll get a pretty decent idea of the kind of activities we offer here at Dry Oar!
        </div></section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Where can I go if I want to join Dry Oar?</h3>
        <div>
            There are a few options! First, there is a "Contact Us" page on the navigation bar at the top of the screen, and second there is 
            a dedicated secition near the bottom of the page labeled "Join Us" (ominious though it may sound, sorry about that). <br> There is
            also a "Contact Us" botton at the bottom of the page, whatever amount of scrolling works for you!
        </div></section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Do yall have any social media channels I can sort through for a better
        understanding of Dry Oar?
    </h3>
        <div>There sure are! We didn't make them hard to find though... Just take a look at the bottom of the webpage, you'll see
            several familiar images. We have profiles on Facebook, TXitter, and Instagram!
        </div></section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Why are you called Dry Oar? Shouldn't oars be wet if they're used for rafting?
    </h3>
        <div> Excellent question! The name is a carry over from some stories about our cofounder in college. 
        The charitable version of the story is that he was so good at white-water rafting that the oars looked like they never touched 
        the water. <br>Of course, the truth is they were so scared of actually getting the water that they would leave pracitce serveral 
        times with their oars being completely dry haha</div> </section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Why haven't I heard of you before? I've seen the taxes you've 
            filed, it doesn't seem to line up with how small your business is</h3>
        <div>Ah, yes. We're a subsidiary of Dry Oar Industries, ourselves being called Dry Oar as well. You must have been mistaken when
            looking at the paper work. That kind of question almost makes us sound suspicious haha! </div> </section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Oh no, I didn't mean to imply that. I was just curious is all. Say, on that 
        topic though, I couldn't but notice that the formal title for the home page reads "Whitewater Rafting 
        and other Money Laundering Schemes". What's that all about?</h3>
        <div>
            Ah, that's very simple. We're having some of our new hires work on updating the website while we 
            focus on some other rafting-related business. It seems that one of their jokes was left in the final 
            webpage, how embarassing! Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we'll make sure that doesn't remain visible to the 
            public for long
        </div> </section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Ah, I see. Even though I haven't booked a rafting trip, I see a van with your
        logo outside my house, can I ask why? Is it for my neighbor and I'm just being paranoid?
    </h3>
        <div>No worries! Here at Dry Oar we pride ourselves on quality customer service, before your even a customer! There's no mistake
            Jeremy. We're not here for your neighbors :)
        </div></section>
    <section class="quest"><input type="checkbox" ><i></i> <h3>Please, I have a wife and two kids. Will they be left out of this?</h3>
    <div>Dry Oar for 25 years running now is one of the best activities for family outings! We'd never even dream of leaving your family 
        behind. <br><br><br>

        <strong><span style="font-size:1.3em;">You brought this on yourself. In the future, please consider who's business it is 
            your sticking your nose in. It's usually not hard to determine if it's yours to mess with! In this case, 
            it most certainly is not

        <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a
